Enhance your YouTube experience with YouTube Fast Forward! This extension adds customizable fast forward and rewind buttons right into the YouTube player, seamlessly fitting with the look and feel of the site.

### What it Offers:
- Adjust fast forward and rewind intervals to suit your preferences.
- Choose whether to override your keyboard's arrow/J+L keys.
- Skip at your own pace: set a custom delay between each skip event and execution timing.
- The buttons blend right into the player by using youtube's UI style.
- Instant Sync Across Tabs: Any changes you make to the skip intervals and seek through values are instantly applied across all open youtube tabs.
- Automatic Save: Your custom settings are saved automatically in your browser's local storage, so you don't have to set them every time.

### Note: 
Please be aware that settings saved in your browser's local storage may be cleared if you clear your browser's cache or cookies.

Skip intervals are adjustable in seconds, with a maximum limit of 99 seconds.

Seek through values are adjustable in milliseconds, with the min/max limits stated under each setting.
